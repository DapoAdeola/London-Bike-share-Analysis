Santander Cycles, also known as the London bike share scheme, is a popular public bicycle sharing system established by Santander Cycles in London. It offers a convenient self-service model where individuals can access bicycles from docking stations without requiring external assistance.

This system allows people in need of bicycles to easily locate and obtain one from any available docking station throughout the city.
